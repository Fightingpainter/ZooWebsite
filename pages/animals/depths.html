                            <p class="text-start">Meet the Grand Leviathan, a creature of remarkable intelligence and complexity. Researchers have found signs of complex emotions and empathy in these creatures, indicating a level of social sophistication rarely seen in the animal kingdom. The Grand Leviathan is a great problem solver, using its wits to navigate the challenges of life in the deep sea. These creatures are known to live in packs of about 15, always traveling. They swim with large distances between each other, forming a circular formation to cover a huge radius. The ones at the outer part serve as lookouts, while the center is reserved for children and babies, providing them with protection. The Grand Leviathan is not known to be harmful and always tries to avoid combat. However, if threatened, it can shed its outer shell, not only creating a decoy but also amplifying its noise-making organs. The loudest call ever recorded from a Grand Leviathan in this state was measured at an astounding 1340 decibels. Witness the Grand Leviathan, a creature of intelligence, empathy, and remarkable adaptability.</p>

                            <p class="text-start">Discover the Blind Swimmer, a creature that has adapted to life in the deep sea in unique ways. This creature can inflate its body to rise quickly to the surface. Once there, it uses its flat back to blend in with the surface of the ocean. It is often found near bodies of land, where it sprays water at birds and other flying creatures, attempting to immobilize them with its weirdly shaped mouth. The Blind Swimmer uses echolocation to locate predators, although it cannot tell the difference between mates and predators, leading to a decline in its population. It also has a stinger for defense, but this is mostly useless as it tends to avoid predators anyway. The Blind Swimmer is a perfect example of a creature that has had some bad luck in the evolutionary line, requiring special care to stay alive</p>

This fish has the ability to make itself heavier to stay on the ground. It uses its legs to stomp on other fish, then eats them off the ground. Its stone-like coloration allows it to blend in with the ocean floor, often leading lower-level IQ predators to ignore it, thinking it's part of the ground. The Legged Fish is a testament to the strange and wonderful ways life can adapt in the deep sea.</p>

This creature's hard outer shell provides a safe haven for smaller fish, while its tentacle-like appendages sense the surrounding water for potential threats. It alerts its inhabitants to danger by sending out weak signals, creating a symbiotic relationship with the smaller fish. The Floating Fortress doesn't move on its own, instead, it floats around like a plant, absorbing nutrients from the gifts or waste of its inhabitants. This creature is a testament to the intricate relationships that exist in the deep sea, where cooperation can be just as important as competition for survival.</p>
